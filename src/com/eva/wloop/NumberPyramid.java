Write a program that outputs a number pyramid like the one below, going on forever (until you press
Ctrl-C to stop the program).
1
22
333
4444
55555
666666
7777777
...
(The formatting of the pyramid will mess up after a few numbers but that is OK for this exercise. If
that bothers you, move on to the second and harder part of this exercise).
