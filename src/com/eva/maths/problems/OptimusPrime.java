/*
Write a program that reads an integer number from the user, and then outputs the closest prime
number. If there are two prime numbers at the same distance, it should output both. For instance,
if the user enters 5116, the output should be 5113 and 5119.
 */

/*TODO
- read in integer, using scanner
- loop backwards from user input number until found a prime (method?)
- loop forwards from user input number until found a prime (method?)
- keep a count in each case and print the closer, if equal, print both
