/*
Pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, can be computed by adding the following
terms:

Create a program that asks the user for a number n and then calculates the partial addition of n terms
of this infinite sum. How many terms do you need to get the first three digits right (3.14)? How
many for the first 10 digits (3.14159265358. . . )?
Hint: to represent fractions in the computer, you can use floating-point numbers. A suitable data type
for floating point numbers in Java is called double (for \double-precision floating-point numbers").
You can use the standard arithmetic operators \+", \-", \*", \/", \>", . . . to work with values of
type double. Doing maths with floating-point numbers will involve small rounding errors, but can be
done very efficiently in a modern computer.

/*TODO
- take input from the user using Scanner
- do a for loop for the sum (up to user input times)
- += (4*(-1)^i)/(2i+1)
- use Math.pow(-1, i)
